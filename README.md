# else-statement
Simple program that controls entrance to a club. Only people who are 18 or older are allowed to enter the club.

The program takes the age of the person who tries to enter, and outputs "Allowed" if they are allowed to enter the club, and "Sorry" if they are younger than the allowed age.
